Joey might have been joking, earnest, or some in-between, but, regardless, that framework is an honest, valuable lens for his record. While a \"twink\" is traditionally portrayed as a submissive, fragile figure, Walker complicates this queer stereotype with active, raw, and devastating songs in the vein of Liz Phair, Scott Walker, and Jason Molina. Sonically, he mixes brooding clean guitar with simple, driving rhythms and electronic textures, his voice floating above, wispy and ethereal.","price":"20.99","id":"0.9262286509420927"}]
